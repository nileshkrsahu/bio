										<h1>About me</h1>
									</header>

									<p>I am Nilesh Kumar Sahu, and I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal. My research focuses on applying computer science to address real-world problems, and I am committed to conducting top-notch research that contributes positively to the field. My areas of expertise include Statistics, Data Science, and Machine Learning. In my current research, I am exploring the utilization of wearable sensors for detecting and mitigating mental disorders. This involves designing studies, collecting data, processing signals, conducting Statistical inference and Multivariate Analysis, performing Data analysis, and developing machine learning models to achieve the research objectives. I am dedicated to making a meaningful impact through my work.</p>

									<p>Recently, I conducted a controlled lab study involving 111 participants. Participants visited the lab to engage in three social activities while wearing body sensors, including ECG and PPG. Additionally, a phone camera recorded both audio and video during these activities. The study aimed to investigate physiological and behavioral markers associated with mental disorders using Statistical inference, Multivariate analysis, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I have submitted four papers from this work in ACM - Interactive, Mobile, Wearable, and Ubiquitous Technologies (1), Transactions on Computing for Healthcare (2), and the Journal on Computing and Sustainable Societies (1).</p>

									<p>My recently published work includes "Comparative Assessment of Smartwatch Photoplethysmography Accuracy," "Exploring Social Media Posts for Depression Identification: A Study on Reddit," and "Understanding Stress: A Web Interface for Mental Arithmetic Tasks in a Trier Social Stress Test." My other submitted works are "AI-Driven Junior Psychologist to Enhance Mental Healthcare Services" and "Investigating Mental Health and Public Perspectives in Rural India: The Role of Digital Technology" in CHI Late-breaking Work.</p>

									<h2>Previous Role - 1. Assistant Professor (May 2021 - Dec 2021)</h2>
									<p>I served as an Assistant Professor of Computer Engineering at Marwadi University, Rajkot, Gujarat (India), where I instructed courses on Python Programming, Python Programming for Data Science, and Machine Learning.</p>
									<p>Despite its brief duration, this experience provided me with a new perspective on my life and answered an inner question: Why pursue a Ph.D.? It played a crucial role in alleviating anxiety and equipped me with the confidence to deliver lectures in front of students and address their queries.</p>

									<h2>Previous Role - 2. Junior Researcher (Aug 2020 - April 2021)</h2>
									<p>I worked as a Junior Researcher at the National Institute of Technology, Durgapur (India), contributing to a project focused on "Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Education," specifically targeting children with learning disabilities.In this research, my primary responsibility was to determine whether a child had a learning disability, utilizing EEG and FNIR signals. My tasks involved signal processing, heatmap generation, performance analysis of data from the EEG machine, and drawing conclusions. I applied machine learning techniques to achieve the project objectives.

									<h2>Previous Role - 3. Intern (May 2020 - March 2021)</h2>
									<p>I gained experience as an Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Intern at Crimsons Angle Pvt. Ltd. (Hiya Works.com). As an intern, I played a crucial role in sampling the dataset, conducting thorough analyses, and preparing the final labeled data, encompassing input and output features. Further, I applied machine learning techniques to meet the objectives outlined in the respective projects.</p>
